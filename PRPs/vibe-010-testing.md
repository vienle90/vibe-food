# PRP-010: Vibe Food Ordering - Testing & E2E Coverage

## Goal

Establish comprehensive testing coverage across the entire Vibe food ordering application to ensure reliability, performance, and maintainability:
- Unit tests for all critical business logic (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Performance testing for load handling and response times
- Security testing for authentication and authorization
- Automated testing pipeline with CI/CD integration
- Test data management and cleanup strategies

## Why

- **Quality Assurance**: Prevent bugs from reaching production
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure new features don't break existing functionality
- **Confidence**: Enable safe refactoring and feature additions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior

### Testing Strategy Context

**Testing Pyramid:**
```
     /\     E2E Tests (Few, High-level, UI workflows)
    /  \
   /____\   Integration Tests (More, API + DB interactions)
  /      \
 /________\  Unit Tests (Many, Fast, Isolated functions)
```

**Critical Test Categories:**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Login, logout, role-based access
2. **Order Workflow**: Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout → Place Order
3. **Store Management**: Menu CRUD operations, store owner permissions
4. **Data Integrity**: Database transactions, foreign key constraints
5. **Error Handling**: Network failures, validation errors, edge cases
6. **Performance**: Response times, concurrent user handling

**Test Data Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests**: Mock data and dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test database with fixtures
- **E2E Tests**: Seeded test database that resets between runs
- **Performance Tests**: Large datasets simulating production load

### Critical Gotchas

1. **Test Isolation**: Tests must not depend on each other or shared state
2. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of promises and async operations
3. **Database Cleanup**: Reset test data between test runs
4. **Authentication Mocking**: Consistent user context across tests
5. **Race Conditions**: Handle concurrent operations in tests

## Implementation Blueprint

### Backend Unit Testing Strategy

**Test Structure (Domain-Driven):**

```

**Backend Unit Test Pattern:**
- **Test Structure**: Organize tests by domain with clear describe blocks
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use Node.js test runner's built-in mocking capabilities
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow clear test structure for readability
- **Error Testing**: Test both success and failure scenarios thoroughly
- **Assertions**: Use strict assertions to catch subtle bugs early

### Frontend Component Testing

**Frontend Component Test Pattern:**
- **User-Centric Testing**: Test behavior from user perspective, not implementation
- **Mock Data**: Create realistic test data that matches production scenarios
- **User Events**: Simulate real user interactions with userEvent library
- **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **State Testing**: Verify component behavior in different states (loading, error, etc.)

### Integration Testing Strategy

**Integration Test Pattern:**
- **Database Setup**: Use separate test database with proper isolation
- **Test Data Management**: Create and clean up test data consistently
- **Authentication Testing**: Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- **API Contract Validation**: Verify request/response formats match specifications
- **Database Verification**: Confirm API operations actually modify database correctly

### E2E Testing Strategy

**End-to-End Test Pattern:**
- **User Journey Testing**: Test complete workflows from user perspective
- **Data Setup**: Seed database with consistent test data before each test
- **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
- **Data Attributes**: Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Test both success paths and error conditions users encounter

### Performance Testing

**Performance Testing Pattern:**
- **Load Scenarios**: Define realistic user load patterns with ramp-up/down phases
- **Performance Thresholds**: Set specific criteria for response times and error rates
- **Critical Endpoints**: Focus testing on most important API endpoints
- **Real User Simulation**: Include think time and realistic usage patterns
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Monitor system resources to identify performance limits

### Test Database Management

**Test Database Management Pattern:**
- **Isolation**: Use separate test database to avoid contaminating production data
- **Migration Management**: Ensure test database schema matches production
- **Data Cleanup**: Clean database between tests to ensure test isolation
- **Seed Data**: Create consistent, realistic test data for all test scenarios
- **Performance**: Optimize test database operations for fast test execution
