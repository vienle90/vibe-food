### User Experience Context

**Order Status Visual Design:**
```
[●] Order Placed      ✓ 2:30 PM
[●] Confirmed         ✓ 2:32 PM
[●] Preparing         ⏳ In Progress
[○] Ready for Pickup  ⌛ Estimated 3:15 PM
[○] Out for Delivery  ⌛ Estimated 3:45 PM
[○] Delivered         ⌛ Estimated 4:00 PM
```

**Order History Layout:**
- **Recent Orders**: Last 5 orders with quick actions
- **Order Cards**: Date, store, total, status, reorder button
- **Filters**: Date range, store, status, amount range
- **Search**: By order number, store name, or item name

**Notification Strategy:**
- **Order Confirmed**: "Your order has been confirmed!"
- **Preparing**: "Your food is being prepared"
- **Ready**: "Your order is ready for pickup!"
- **Out for Delivery**: "Your order is on the way!"
- **Delivered**: "Enjoy your meal! Rate your experience"

### Technical Patterns

**Real-time Status Updates Pattern:**
- **WebSocket Connection**: Establish persistent connection for live order updates
- **State Management**: Track status and estimated delivery time with proper state updates
- **User Notifications**: Show toast notifications for important status changes
- **Connection Cleanup**: Properly close WebSocket connections to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Handle connection failures and implement reconnection logic

**Order History Pagination Pattern:**
- **Infinite Query**: Use TanStack Query's infinite query for seamless pagination
- **Page Parameters**: Implement cursor-based or offset-based pagination efficiently
- **Cache Management**: Configure proper cache invalidation and data persistence
- **Loading States**: Handle loading, error, and empty states gracefully
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large order histories

### Performance Considerations

**Order History Optimization:**
- Virtualized scrolling for large order lists
- Image lazy loading for order item photos
- Query caching with stale-while-revalidate
- Skeleton loading during data fetching

**Real-time Connection Management:**
- Connection pooling for multiple active orders
- Automatic reconnection on network failures
- Graceful degradation when WebSocket unavailable
- Battery optimization for mobile devices

### Critical Gotchas

1. **WebSocket Management**: Proper connection cleanup to prevent memory leaks
2. **Notification Permissions**: Handle denied notification permissions gracefully
3. **Offline Handling**: Cache order status for offline viewing
4. **Time Zones**: Display times in user's local timezone
5. **Large Order History**: Efficient pagination and search

## Implementation Blueprint
