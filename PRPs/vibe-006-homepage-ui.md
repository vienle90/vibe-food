### Design Context

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Hero Section**: Search bar + category filters (prominent)
2. **Store Grid**: 2-3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile
3. **Store Cards**: Image, name, category badge, rating, delivery info
4. **Pagination**: Bottom of page with page numbers

**Category Design:**
- Visual category badges with icons (üçï Lunch, ‚òï Coffee, üç∞ Dessert)
- Active/inactive states with color changes
- Horizontal scroll on mobile for many categories

**Store Card Layout:**
```
[Store Image - 16:9 ratio]
[Store Name - Bold, large]
[Category Badge] [Rating ‚≠ê 4.5]
[Delivery: 25-35 min] [Fee: $2.99]
```

### Technical Patterns

**State Management Strategy:**
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data (stores, filters)
- **Client State**: useState for search input, selected filters
- **URL State**: Search params for shareable filtering state
- **No Global State**: Keep state local to homepage feature

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Debounced search (300ms delay)
- Infinite scroll or cursor-based pagination
- Image lazy loading with Next.js Image
- Query caching with stale-while-revalidate
- Skeleton loading for better perceived performance

### Critical Gotchas

1. **Search Debouncing**: Prevent API calls on every keystroke
2. **Filter State**: Keep URL in sync with active filters for sharing
3. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image with proper sizes
4. **Loading States**: Prevent layout shift during transitions
5. **Mobile Touch**: Ensure adequate touch targets (44px minimum)

## Implementation Blueprint

### Page Structure (App Router)
```
app/
  page.tsx                 # Homepage (main store listing)
  stores/
    [storeId]/
      page.tsx            # Store details page
  components/
    store-list/
      StoreCard.tsx       # Individual store card
      StoreGrid.tsx       # Grid layout component
      StoreFilters.tsx    # Category and search filters
      StorePagination.tsx # Pagination controls
  hooks/
    useStores.tsx         # TanStack Query hook
    useSearchFilters.tsx  # Filter state management
```

### Component Architecture

**Homepage Component Flow:**
```
HomePage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StoreFilters (search + categories)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StoreGrid
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StoreCard (repeated)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StoreCardSkeleton (loading)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EmptyState (no results)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StorePagination
```

### Key Component Patterns

**Store Card Component Pattern:**
- **Props Interface**: Define clear TypeScript interfaces with proper branded types
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component with priority loading for above-fold cards
- **User Interactions**: Handle click events for navigation with proper accessibility
- **Visual Design**: Display rating with stars, delivery info, and category badges
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for images and proper memoization

**Store Filters Component Pattern:**
- **Debounced Search**: Implement 300ms debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
- **Active State Management**: Visual feedback for selected categories with proper contrast
- **Mobile Responsive**: Horizontal scrolling for categories on mobile devices
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset all filters with single action and URL update
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### API Integration Pattern

**TanStack Query Hook Pattern:**
- **Query Key Strategy**: Include all filter parameters for proper cache invalidation
- **Stale Time Configuration**: Set appropriate stale time (5 minutes) for store data
- **Smooth Transitions**: Use keepPreviousData to prevent loading flickers during filtering
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic and error boundary integration
- **Cache Management**: Configure proper garbage collection and cache persistence

**URL State Management Pattern:**
- **Shareable State**: Sync all filter state with URL parameters for bookmarking
- **History Navigation**: Support browser back/forward buttons properly
- **Parameter Validation**: Validate URL parameters with Zod schemas
- **Default Values**: Handle missing or invalid URL parameters gracefully
- **Performance**: Use useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoint Usage:**
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single column, horizontal category scroll
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Two columns, visible category grid
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Three columns, full category display

**Responsive Design Pattern:**
- **Mobile First**: Start with single column, expand for larger screens
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Use md: for tablet (768px) and lg: for desktop (1024px)
- **Touch Interactions**: Horizontal scroll on mobile with momentum scrolling
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts to screen size and content
- **Spacing**: Consistent gap and padding using Tailwind spacing scale

### Loading and Error States

**Loading Strategy:**
- Show skeleton cards during initial load
- Show spinner overlay during filter changes
- Maintain existing cards during pagination

**Error Handling:**
- Network errors: Retry button with offline message
- No results: Empty state with search suggestions
- Server errors: Generic error message with support contact

## Validation Loop

# Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Should see API call to /api/stores with 200 response
# Should render store cards with images, names, ratings

# Test empty state
# Temporarily stop backend or return empty array
# Should show "No stores found" message with helpful suggestions
```

### Level 3: Filtering Functionality
```bash
# Test category filtering
# Click different category buttons
# URL should update: /?category=LUNCH
# API should be called with category parameter
# Results should update to show only selected category

# Test search functionality
# Type in search box (wait for debounce)
# URL should update: /?search=pizza
# API should be called with search parameter
# Results should show matching stores
```
